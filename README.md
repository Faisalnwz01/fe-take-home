# Take-Home Challenge

Our goal for this challenge is to implement a quick-search functionality that mimics the macOS Spotlight feature. If you are not familiar with it, Spotlight is a simple UI component that allows you to search for content using a keyword.

Here is a screenshot of it in action.

Using Angular or React, we want to replicate a similar functionality in the browser by searching against a predefined list of objects.
The searchable objects can be found in data.json
